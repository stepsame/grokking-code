"""
Array Index & Element Equality
Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers, write a function indexEqualsValueSearch that returns the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i.
Return -1 if there is no such index. Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution and explain its correctness.
input: arr = [-8,0,2,5]
output: 2 # since arr[2] == 2
input: arr = [-1,0,3,6]
output: -1 # since no index in arr satisfies arr[i] == i.
"""

"""
Solution:
Because the imputed array is sorted, we could use the binary search algorithm to search the answer.

For every loop in the binary search, we compare the middle elementâ€™s value to its index.

There are 4 cases:
If the value is equal to the index and the previous one is not equal,  then we find the answer.
If they are equal but the previous one is equal, the answer will be in the left part.
If the value is less than the index, the answer will be in the right part.
If the value is greater than the index, the answer will be in the left part, same in case 2.


Time Complexity: O(logN) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
