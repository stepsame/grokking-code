Find The Duplicates

Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of passport numbers, implement a function findDuplicates that returns an array of all passport numbers
that are both in arr1 and arr2. Note that the output array should be sorted in an ascending order.

Let N and M be the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively. Solve for two cases and analyze the time & space complexities of your solutions:
  M ≈ N - the array lengths are approximately the same
  M ≫ N - arr2 is much bigger than arr1.

input:  arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], arr2 = [3, 6, 7, 8, 20]
output: [3, 6, 7]

"""

"""
Solution 1:
if M is equal to N, then we can use two pointers iterator two arrays.
Time Complexity: O(M+N) iterator two arrays
Space Complexity: O(N) for the output array

--------------------
Solution 2:
if M is much bigger than N, then we can iterator the smaller array, then using binary search for the bigger array.

Time Complexity: O(M * log N) binary search is O(log N), for M times
Space Complexity: O(N) for the output array
