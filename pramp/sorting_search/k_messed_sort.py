K-Messed Array Sort
Given an array of integers arr where each element is at most k places away from its sorted position, code an efficient function sortKMessedArray that sorts arr.
For instance, for an input array of size 10 and k = 2, an element belonging to index 6 in the sorted array
will be located at either index 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 in the input array.
input:  arr = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6, 10, 9], k = 2
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

import heapq

"""
Solution:
The idea is to construct a min-heap of size k+1 and insert the first k+1 elements into the heap.
Then we remove min from the heap and insert the next element from the array into the heap 
and continue the process until both array and heap are exhausted.
Each pop operation from the heap should insert the corresponding top element in its correct position in the array.

Time Complexity:
building a heap takes O(K) time for K+1 elements. Insertion into and extraction from the min-heap take O(log(K)), each.
Across all three loops, we do at least one of these actions N times, so the total time complexity is O(Nâ‹…log(K)).
if K is substantially smaller than N, then we can consider log(K) constant and argue that the complexity is practically linear.
Space Complexity:
we need to a maintain min-heap of size K+1 throughout the algorithm, so the auxiliary space complexity is O(K).
